Hi, I'm Colin.

I'm an engineering student who likes learning about technology, business, and design.

I'm writing this blog to help you solve problems that I've encountered. "What kind of problems?", you might ask.

How about:

* assimilating new technologies quickly
* becoming more productive
* learning new business approaches
* designing things without a design background
* and any other problems I run into
    
If these are issues for you, then stay tuned. I'll update this blog weekly.

Until next time.
